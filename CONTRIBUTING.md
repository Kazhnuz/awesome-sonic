Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

- Try to make your pull request as descriptive as possible, especially the title. "Update Readme.md" makes it harder for us to see directly what your pull request is about :)

- Keep descriptions short, simple and to the point.

- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.

- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).

- Please check your grammar and spelling as much as possible.

- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

- Please check that your contribution follows the following requirements :

  - It's a creation based on the Sonic the Hedgehog Franchise. Hacks that add character from another franchise into a Sonic game are accepted.
  
  - The creation must be a creation that is complete enough to be a good experience. It can be either a small project (one-level hack or fangame, one-issue comic-book) or epic lenght content.
  
  - Some exceptions to this rules includes :
  
    - Abandonned games that already give a big enough experience Ã  la Sonic Fusion
    
    - Ongoing series of comics, that won't be ever "finished" by any standard. For one to be proposed, it must have at least one issue.
    
    - Modding-based game like SRB2 or Sonic World
  
- Please follow the classification file (classification.md). If it doesn't fit, please add an issue with the "categories" label.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
